                <p id="words"> Here at Granny's Recipes, our mission is to help people make the
                    best baked goods on the planet. Our founder Raven Griffin always
                    loved baking with her Great Granny. After her Grandmother's
                    passing, she decided to share her recipes with the world.
                    We pride ourselves on giving the best recipes for the most delicious baked goods
                    for no price at all.
