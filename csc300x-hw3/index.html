<h1>Introduction</h1>
<pre>Are you a freshmen tired of the caf? 
A student who has a flex only plan? 
Or a commuter who forgot their lunch?
You can always eat on Campus.  
There are tons of places that accept cash, card, and flex.
As a student with a flex only meal plan, 
I can give you insight into the best places to eat.
